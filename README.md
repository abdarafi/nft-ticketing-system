# NFT-based Ticketing System

This project is a NFT-based ticketing system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses Solidity for smart contracts, Ganache for local blockchain emulation, Truffle Suite for contract deployment, and Web3.js for frontend interaction.

## Features

- Minting Tickets: Event organizers can create unique, non-duplicable tickets as NFTs.
- Buying and Selling Tickets: Users can securely buy and sell tickets on the platform with transactions and ownership changes recorded on the blockchain.
- Verifying Ownership: The ownership of each ticket can be verified on-chain, eliminating counterfeits.
- Dynamic Pricing: Ticket prices are defined by event organizers and can be dynamic, offering the possibility of price adjustments based on various factors.
